# UoM Blackboard theme

This project applies [Google's Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) to
the University of Manchester's websites.

This is more than just a theme; it also vastly improves the usability
and readability of the websites.

I was originally only restyling Blackboard, but I've since expanded it to
other UoM websites.
