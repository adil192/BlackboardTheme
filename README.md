## Why use this theme?

- Rethemes the login and duo pages
    - Removes the useless FAQs no-one reads and adds a nice picture of Uni Place
- Rethemes the My Manchester portal including the attendance page
    - (My Manchester is currently offline anyway)
- Rethemes Blackboard videos
   - Captions are more readable with better fonts and a smaller width
   - More readable progress bar
- Styling and colouring inspired by [Google's Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)
